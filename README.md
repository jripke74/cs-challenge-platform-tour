STEP 2
Add your name
Now, let’s make a small change to the program. Can you personalize the welcome message?

Find the place in the code where the word "learner" appears.
Replace the word "learner" with your name.
Press the Run button.
When you run the program, you should now see it welcome you by name! If not, make sure you didn’t change any other code by accident.

You can press the Start over button at any time to get back to the original version of the program, but note that it returns you to the first step.

STEP 3
Add a new message
Next, let’s add our own message!

Type print("You got this!") on a new line at the bottom of the program.
Press the Run button.
When you run the program, you should see the message You got this! appear in the console, after the first two messages. If not, make sure you typed the statement exactly as it appears.

Note that there should be no spaces between the statement print("You got this!") and the left margin.
