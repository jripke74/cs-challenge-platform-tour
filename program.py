# Instructions
# STEP 1
# Press Run
# In a Challenge, there are three main panels: one for the 
# instructions, one for the code editor where you write your 
# program, and one for the console where your program output appears 
# - but only after you press the Run button!

# You should run your code frequently to test your changes and to 
# spot any errors early.

# Press the Run button.
# On each run, the platform also evaluates your program to see if 
# you correctly completed the instructions for the current step and 
# are ready to move on to the next. Sometimes, it may even give you 
# a free tip to help you along!
# Press the Run button to see this Python program in action.
